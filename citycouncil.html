        <p>Subang Jaya City Council (MBSJ; Malay: Majlis Bandaraya Subang Jaya) is the city council which is in charge of the Subang Jaya city and the southern parts of Petaling district including Puchong. This agency is under Selangor state government of Malaysia. 

            <br><br>MBSJ are responsible for the public's health and sanitation, waste removal and management, town planning, environmental protection and building control, social and economic development and general maintenance functions of urban infrastructure. The MBSJ headquarters is located in UEP Subang Jaya.
            
            <br><br>In the 1970s the Selangor state government established the Petaling District Council (Majlis Daerah Petaling, MDP) under section 4 of the Local Government Act 1976. In 1994, the state government decided to upgrade the authority to the status of a municipal council (majlis perbandaran), and rename it the Subang Jaya Municipal Council. 
            <br><br>The Subang Jaya Municipal Council was formed on 1 January 1997, by combining the existing Petaling District Council with several areas ceded from the Petaling Jaya Municipal Council (MPPJ) and Shah Alam Municipal Council (MPSA).
            
            In December 2019, the Subang Jaya Municipal Council was granted the approval from the federal government to elevate its status from a City Council to become Subang Jaya City Council (MBSJ), which was gazetted on 20 October 2020.</p>
