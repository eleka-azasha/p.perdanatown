                 <p style="font-size: medium;">The As-Salam Mosque, affectionately termed the Floating Mosque, stands as an iconic architectural wonder in Malaysia. Nestled gracefully by the tranquil shores of a man-made lake in Puchong Perdana, Selangor, it epitomizes the common tradition of situating mosques near water bodies to harness the cooling effects amidst Malaysia's warm climate. Officially unveiled in 2006 by Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah of Selangor, this majestic structure has garnered acclaim as one of Malaysia's most remarkable mosques.

                    Comprehensively equipped with amenities such as a primary prayer hall, a dedicated space for female worshippers, administrative offices, a travelers' lodge, and versatile meeting facilities, the mosque caters to the diverse needs of its local community. Nestled adjacent to a verdant public park and nestled amidst educational institutions and residential enclaves, its three grand domes and soaring minaret have become quintessential symbols visible from afar. Inspired by a fusion of Arabian, Byzantine, and Ottoman architectural influences, the mosque's design features elegant pointed arches, intricate Islamic geometrical patterns, and a contemporary postmodern flair.
                    
                    Internally, the main prayer hall is bathed in natural light, complemented by thoughtfully positioned windows and strategically placed free-standing pillars fitted with mechanical fans for optimal ventilation. Adorned with exquisite tile work and a meticulously embellished mihrab wall, the hall exudes an atmosphere of tranquility conducive to devout reflection and prayer. Seamlessly blending traditional Islamic motifs with modern design sensibilities, the As-Salam Mosque stands as a testament to Malaysia's cultural richness and architectural innovation.</p>
